1.0 Network fundamentals 

1.1 Role/Function of components 
1.1.1 Routers: 
	Forwards packets between subnets 
	1.1.2 L2 & L3 Switches: segment broadcast networks  
		L2: moves packets within a VLAN; makes forwarding decisions based on 
MAC address of a packet  
If unknown MAC address received = flood packets to all ports except receiving port 
	1.1.3 Next-gen firewalls & IPS:, packet-filtering, proxy service, stateful inspection
	1.1.4 Access Points: provides Wi-Fi devices with a connection to a wired network  
	1.1.5 Controllers (Cisco DNA Center & WLC)
WLC: manages access points 
Benefit of WLC:  eliminates the need to configure each access point individually. 
	1.1.6 Endpoints 
	1.1.7 Servers 
	 handles requests from multiple workstations at the same time
runs applications that send and retrieve data for workstations that make requests
	1.1.8 PoE
PoE monitoring and policing: If the power consumption on a monitored port exceeds the administrative maximum value, the following actions occur: 
- A syslog message is issued. 
- The monitored port is shut down and error-disabled. 
- The allocated power is freed.
1.2 Network Topology Architectures 
1.2.1 two-tier 
Collapsed core layer is used to enforce routing policies 
1.2.2 three-tier  
The distribution layer runs Layer 2 and Layer 3 technologies
The network core: designed to maintain continuous connectivity when devices fail; provides uninterrupted forwarding service & ensures timely data transfer between layers 

1.2.3 Spine-leaf 
	provides high-bandwidth, low-latency, non blocking server-to-server connectivity. 
Scalability: A leaf switch can be added with connections to every spine switch. 
Each device is separated by the same number of hops.
1.2.4 WAN 
1.2.5 Small/home office (SOHO)
	Broadband cable access preferred  
On-premise & cloud 

1.3 physical interface vs cabling types 
	1.3.1 single-mode fiber, multimode fiber, copper 
		Optical fiber - glass core component is encased in cladding
		Light is transmitted via core of the fiber 
Both copper & fiber interfaces provide minimal interruption by being hot-swappable when using SFP modules

	1.3.2 Connections (ethernet shared media [broadcast] & point-to-point)

1.4 identity interface & cable issues 
	Collisions, errors, mismatch duplex, and/or speed
	1.4.1 late collisions (after 64-bit frame) = cable length exceeded or too many repeaters in a network 
	1.4.2 full-duplex/half-duplex mismatch,exceeded cable length limits, or defective hardware (incorrect cabling, bad NIC, non-compliant num of hubs) 
Limit collisions: use: 1,6,11 2.4-GHz channel 

1.5 TCP vs UDP 
TCP: connection-oriented, sends packets in a stream, low transmission rate for higher 
Reliability, 3-way handshake authentication;   
	
Udp: connectionless; sends packets individually, high transmission rate for apps, Doesn’t guarantee delivery, checksums for authentication, includes an 8-byte header   
		Advantage (app traffic): lower overhead than TCP traffic, application can use checksums to verify the integrity of application data
	
1.6 Config & verify IPv4 Addressing & subnetting 

1.7 Describe need for private IPv4 addressing 
Less costly than public IP addresses. 
Can be assigned to devices without Internet connections	
Conserve IPv4 & global address space
Reduce risk of a security breach 
Allows multiple companies to each use the same addresses without conflicts
Inter-enterprise comm 

1.8 Config & verify IPv6 Addressing & prefix 
When configuring IPv6 on an interface: join FF02::1 & FF02::2 multicasts

1.9 Describe IPv6 address types
	Unicast (global, unique local, link local)
		Global: 
		Unique-local: communication between subnets and cannot route 
on the Internet; FC00::/7
Link-local: communications within the local subnet; dynamically created 
using prefix FE80::/10 & EUI-64 id (automatic address configuration, neighbor discovery, router discovery)
	
	Anycast
	Multicast : FF00::/8
	Modified EUI 64
		When an EUI-64 address is gen: 7th bit of original MAC address is inverted

1.10 Verify IP params for Client OS (windows, mac, linux)
In windows, use GUI or command line: ‘ipconfig/all’
	Troubleshooting: ping; tracert; nslookup; netstat-r  
MAC/linux: ‘ifconfig’   
Verify the host has the correct IP in the same subnet with its default gateway or router. 
each host must have individual IP & subnet mask
Verify def-gateway/router info: host must know the def gateway ip (in same subnet)
Verify DNS info: host must know the DNS info of 1 or more servers

Default gateway 
Host ip address
NIC MAC address
NIC vendor OUI
Subnet mask 


1.11 Wireless Principles 
	Non-overlapping Wi-Fi channels 
	SSID: w 
	RF
Encryption: 
Symmetric-performance: AES, 3DES, RC4, E0 
Compute public key from private key & vise versa  
Use cases: banking (PII), data storage  
asymmetric-key cryptography: RSA; DSA, DH 
	Use cases: digital signatures, blockchain & PKI
	WPA: TKIP - RC4, 
WPA2: AES-256 - preshared mode  
WPA3 -  -SAE-AES-CCMP

1.12 Virtualization Fundamentals 
The hypervisor can virtualize physical components including CPU, memory, and storage.
	Server virtualization 
	Containers 
	VRFs

1.13 Switching concepts
	MAC learning & aging
Frame switching
Frame flooding  
Frames are sent to every port on the switch in the same VLAN except from the originating port.
	MAC address table

Network Access

After enabling DAI, all ports become untrusted ports.
